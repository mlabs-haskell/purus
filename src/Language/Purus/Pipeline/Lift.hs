{- Given a collection of declarations that will be lifted, determine for each declaration
   the "deep" (recursive) set of NEW variable dependencies which need to be added
   as additional arguments.

   That is, for:

   ```
   testForLift :: Int -> Boolean
   testForLift x = h x 3
     where
       h a b = g a <= j 4 b
       j c d = c + g d
       g a = if h a x then j x 1 else x * x
   ```

   the resulting map would be:
     h := [x],
     j := [x],
     g := [x]

   `g` references an `x` that is in scope at the original declaration, but will
    become out of scope when `g` is lifted, so must be added as an argument.

   `h` and `j` reference `g` and therefore incur that dependency, so `x` must be
   added as an argument to their lifted declaration bodies as well.

{- Given a "main" expression (and implicit access to the module context via the

   NOTE: The first argument is the name of the 'main' declaration. We need this to handle the case where the main function is
         self-recursive. *IN PRODUCTION* that doesn't matter at all, because a validator or minting policy cannot be
         (sensibly) self-recursive. However, it's essential for testing (we need to evaluate some self-recursive
         functions to check other parts of the compiler).

{- NOTE 1:

   We need three different functions, each of which is (modulo the Inline monad)
   morally a function :: Exp -> Exp

   1) We need a function that updates call sites in the body of the expression(s) inside the
      scope of the original let- bound declaration we're lifting. This situation is distinct from
      updating the call sites in *other lifted expressions*, because in the original body context,
      we are applying variables which *must* be in scope already, and so should use the *original*
      "was-in-scope-before-lifting-but-is-out-of-scope-after-lifting" BVars (which we have acces to).

   2) We need a function that updates call sites *in all lifted expressions* , i.e. (but not exclusively)
      other members of the mutually recursive binding group in which the declaration being lifted is defined (this
      might also occur for other lifted expressions inside the scope of the binding being lifted).

      Here, we need to generate new unique indices for the variables being applied, which must be done in the
      'Inline' monad. We can generate a Map from the old indices to the new indices "all at once" for the totality of
      lifted declarations and pass it around.

      Furthermore, because the new(ly re-indexed) variables must be added as lambda arguments on the LHS of *each*
      other lifted declaration, they must (to preserve global uniqueness) be specific to each lifted declaration.

   3) We need a function that modifies the declaration being lifted with additional lambdas (at the *front*, I think that's easier)
      for each new variable which may have been bound in the original context but is free in the lifted declaration
      (prior to this transformation). We need to ensure that:
         - a: The newly introduced binders contain variables with *fresh* indices
         - b: The "stale" variables (which at this point have the original indices from the scope where they
              are first bound in the context we are lifting *from*) are updated with the corresponding fresh indices
         - c: Any self-recursive calls to the function declaration being lifted are supplied with fresh arguments.

   In practice we combine 2) and 3)

   This is all somewhat complicated by the fact that we cannot deduce the *deep* set of dependencies
   from the structure of a particular to-be-lifted declaration. This is confusing, so to illustrate
   the point, consider:

   ```
    f :: Int -> Boolean
    f x = h x 3
      where
        h a b = g a <= j 4 b
        j c d = c + g d
        g a = if h a x then j x 1 else x * x
   ```

   In our AST, this desugars to (something like):

   ```
    f :: Int -> Boolean
    f = \(x: Int) ->
      let h a b = g a <= j 4 b
          j c d = c + g d
          g a = if h a x then j x 1 else x * x
      in h x 3
   ```

   The bound variable 'x' occurs *directly* in the body of `g` and in no other let-bound declaration.
   A naive attempt at lifting might yield:

   ```
   let h a b = g a <= j 4 b
       j c d = c + g d
       g x a = if h a x then j x 1 else x * x
   in (...)
   ```

   But this is wrong! (If you're reading this, try to spot the error for a second before moving to the next paragraph.)

   The problem with this attempt at lifting is that `g` occurs in both `h` and `j`, and so both `h` and `j`
   need to take an additional argument and apply it to the `g` contained within their declaration body.

   The point of this example is to demonstrate that the full dependencies of a given declaration must be known
   (where full means: the direct dependencies *and* any dependencies of the direct one, and recursively, etc).

   `getDeep` (...if it works...) fetches those dependencies for us (and this is why we had to construct all of those maps above).
